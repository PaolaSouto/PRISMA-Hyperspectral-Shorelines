# PRISMA-Hyperspectral-Shorelines
These codes allow to extract subpixel shorelines with two different methods from PRISMA hyperspectral images as described in the publication: "Subpixel shoreline mapping tool from PRISMA hyperspectral remotely-sensed images.‚Äù

https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15082117

## Data

The codes work with PRISMA hyperspectral images distributed by the "Agenzia Spaziale Italiana" (ASI) after request. For the image license request access to the link https://www.asi.it/scienze-della-terra/prisma/ and click on "portale PRISMA" as indicated with the red arrow on the image below.

A short project of, at least, 150 words must be sent, and ASI will release the license within a few days. 

## 1. Installation

### Create Anaconda environment

Several steps are required before running the codes.

1. Install *Anaconda*, which can be download from https://www.anaconda.com/download.

Using the shell (Mac and Linux):

2. Go to the folder where this repository was downloaded by tipping: 'cd repository_directory'
3. Create an environment containing the required Python packages: `conda env create -f PRISMA_SDS.yml`
4. Activate the environment: `conda activate PRISMA_sds`
5. Launch jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

### Before running the jupyter notebooks

Check the pre-requirements.

MANDATORY :warning:

* The folder structure [function already done. Really optim?] [add also the folder name]
* The PRISMA images [bounding box] or [cropped image]. Check if those options are both really offered. IMAGE NAMING
* Image grid
* Beach baseline

OPTIONAL

* Pre-defined files
* Bounding Box file
* Nothing else

### Run the jupyter notebooks

Shorelines can be obtained using two methods, each with its own jupyter notebook: the profiles and the k-means approach.


* #### Profiles approach: Profiles_method.ipynb




* #### K-means approach: kmeans_method.ipynb




### Outputs

The results for each algorithm were one. txt and one .geojson with the Satellite-Derived Shoreline of the analyzed image. The .txt is given in image coordinates, whereas the geojson is in real-world coordinates.
